This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: forgetting to close files properly after opening them.  The `bug.py` file contains a function that opens a file for writing but omits the crucial `f.close()` call. This can result in resource leaks and data loss.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version, showcasing the proper way to handle file I/O with context managers to ensure files are always closed.
